# coffee-shop-mockup


Coffee Hero is a mockup website for a business. I decided to build this project to challenge myslef to build a full-scale website using Bootstrap 5.

I was very determined in this project to push my ability to problem solve. I decided early on I wanted to create a unique navigation menu that floated on top
of the carousel images. I am especially pleased with how this turned out. 

## Features

- Clean UI implementing basicdesign principles
- Eye catching colors with a clean modern layout
